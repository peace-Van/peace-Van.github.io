[The 2023 state of the climate report: Entering uncharted territory](https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/advance-article/doi/10.1093/biosci/biad080/7319571)   
   
I would like to use this article as the headline for this category. I suggest everyone read the full text. For those who don't have that patience, here are some key takeaways:  
   
>Unfortunately, time is up. We are seeing the manifestation of those predictions as an alarming and unprecedented succession of climate records are broken, causing profoundly distressing scenes of suffering to unfold. We are entering an unfamiliar domain regarding our climate crisis, a situation no one has ever witnessed firsthand in the history of humanity.
   
>The fundamental challenge lies in the difficulty of decoupling economic growth from harmful environmental impacts. The impacts vary greatly by wealth; in 2019, the top 10% of emitters were responsible for 48% of global emissions, whereas the bottom 50% were responsible for just 12%. We therefore need to change our economy to a system that supports meeting basic needs for all people instead of excessive consumption by the wealthy.  
   
>To achieve socioeconomic justice and universal human well-being, it is crucial to strive for a convergence in per capita resource and energy consumption worldwide. This entails working toward balanced and equitable levels of energy and resource consumption for both the global north and south.   
   
>We must shift our perspective on the climate emergency from being just an isolated environmental issue to a systemic, existential threat. We need policies that target the underlying issues of ecological overshoot where the human demand on Earth’s resources results in overexploitation of our planet and biodiversity decline. As long as humanity continues to exert extreme pressure on the Earth, any attempted climateonly solutions will only redistribute this pressure.   

>We warn of potential collapse of natural and socioeconomic systems in such a world where we will face unbearable heat, frequent extreme weather events, food and fresh water shortages, rising seas, more emerging diseases, and increased social unrest and geopolitical conflict. Massive suffering due to climate change is already here, and we have now exceeded many safe and just Earth system boundaries, imperiling stability and life-support systems. As we will soon bear witness to failing to meet the Paris agreement’s aspirational 1.5°C goal, the significance of immediately curbing fossil fuel use and preventing every further 0.1°C increase in future global heating cannot be overstated. Rather than focusing only on carbon reduction and climate change, addressing the underlying issue of ecological overshoot will give us our best shot at surviving these challenges in the long run. This is our moment to make a profound difference for all life on Earth, and we must embrace it with unwavering courage and determination to create a legacy of change that will stand the test of time.
   
I'm a doomer. I don't think humanity can survive this. Greed is baked in humanity as much as Earth resources are limited. Inequality, competition, divided political landscape... All preventing humanity to cooperate on such an existential threat.   
   
Still I hope to voice up a bit, so my years at least have some value. Unlike Greta Thunberg, I'm a coward chickening out on this small blog.
