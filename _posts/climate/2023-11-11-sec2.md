[Sec 1.](https://peace-van.github.io/climate/2023/11/08/sec1.html) introduced the methodology of NN learning of vegetation mapping, mainly the dataset and the NN structure. This article will focus on the result and some insights from it.  

## NN parameters

In this part I will discuss the parameters that are interpretable.

### Custom activation layer

As discussed in Sec 1, this layer simulates the empirical comparison against thresholds. The training result shows most of the thresholds did not move far away from Köppen's estimation. A notable observation is that $\sigma_{p_i}$ significantly increase with higher precipitation level $i$. This means that the network learned that overabundant precipitation rarely affect the vegetation so it deemed weaker discriminatory power on higher precipitation.

| Parameter      | Initial value | Learned value |
|----------------|---------------|---------------|
| $\mu_{t_1}$    | -18           | -16.9         |
| $\mu_{t_2}$    | 0             | 0.6           |
| $\mu_{t_3}$    | 10            | 10.7          |
| $\mu_{t_4}$    | 22            | 25.3          |
| $\sigma_t$     | 4             | 4.5           |
| $\mu_{p_1}$    | 10            | 7.7           |
| $\mu_{p_2}$    | 40            | 37.2          |
| $\mu_{p_3}$    | 100           | 105.7         |
| $\sigma_{p_1}$ | 10            | 10.0          |
| $\sigma_{p_2}$ | 20            | 27.1          |
| $\sigma_{p_3}$ | 30            | 59.2          |

### `fc-2` layer

This is the last layer before output that has learnable parameters. Each output neuron of this layer corresponds to a land cover type. It can be seen that predictions for *deciduous needleleaf forest*, *closed shrubland* and *permanent wetland* were severely suppressed by this layer. These types are relatively rare around the world. The bias parameters do not interact with the input climate data in forward propagation and thus can be seen in an average sense as indicators of impact from factors other than climate on land cover. The potential natural vegetation ([Tomislav Hengl et al. 2018](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30155360/)) may be obtained by setting these parameters to zero and then passing climate data again through the trained network, which is another topic for future exploration.

| Land cover type             | Cover percentage | Learned bias |
|-----------------------------|------------------|--------------|
| evergreen needleleaf forest | 2.32%            | -0.19        |
| deciduous needleleaf forest | 0.32%            | -1.67        |
| evergreen broadleaf forest  | 6.94%            | 0.88         |
| deciduous broadleaf forest  | 1.95%            | -0.47        |
| mixed forest                | 3.94%            | 0.27         |
| closed shrubland            | 0.31%            | -1.63        |
| open shrubland              | 10.54%           | 0.31         |
| woody savanna               | 8.97%            | 0.18         |
| savanna                     | 11.29%           | 0.15         |
| grassland                   | 22.38%           | 0.09         |
| permanent wetland           | 3.87%            | -1.60        |
| cropland mosaics            | 8.58%            | 0.24         |
| snow and ice                | 4.98%            | -0.30        |
| barren                      | 13.62%           | -0.28        |

## Land cover classification

The task that the neural network accomplished is to classify the climate normal data according to their underlying land cover conditions. It's basically a multi-label classification problem. Meanwhile we hope it utilizes more information than just the label with the highest percentage (*predominant land cover type*), so we use the binary cross-entropy loss, expecting the NN to output the correct percentages. 

In this part we reduce the problem to multi-label classification. If we see the correct label as the one with the highest percentage on the land pixel, how is the network's performance and accuracy?

Confusion chart.   

From the confusion chart it can be seen that the network accurately identified land cover types such as *barren* and *ice* which are marked by pronounced climate features. Types that are underrepresented or have no clear climate features, such as *closed shrubland* and *permanent wetland*, are challenging for the network (as well as humans). The prediction achieved an overall accuracy of 82.84%. The [Kappa statistic](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/030438009290003W) $\kappa$ is 0.8036, indicating very good agreement between real-world data and the prediction. The accuracy can be bounded by the problem’s nature: land cover is the result of multiple factors, including but not limited to climate, terrain topology and human activities. Accurate prediction of a region’s land cover merely by the local climate may imply overfitting.

## Climate features

![p5](/assets/NN2/feature1-Damp-coldness.png)
![p6](/assets/NN2/feature2-Continentality.png)
![p7](/assets/NN2/feature3-Growing Season.png)
Three principle climate features extracted by the network. Brighter regions represent higher values. From top to bottom, feature 1, explaining 36.34% of information, implies **damp-coldness**. Feature 2, explaining 16.67%, can be regarded as **continentality**. Feature 3, explaining 14.29%, indicates the **seasonal contrast** in growth capability.  

> Continentality basically represents aridity. For two observations with similar aridity, the one with colder temperature has a higher value.
> The first feature basically represents temperature level. For two observations with similar temperature, the one with less aridity has a higher value. Hopefully someone could give this feature a better name.   
> **Warmth is naturally linked with dryness by causing higher evaporation.** In view of this fact, temperature level and aridity are not independent, while principle components are required to be independent. PCA on the learned climate features defines a new climate terminology for us - **the orthogonal counterpart of continentality**. These two features form the orthogonal basis on the temperature-precipitation/aridity plane.  
> The third feature, seasonality, represents the starkness of growing season. For example, the savanna climate has a high value of this feature due to its distinct dry-wet season pattern. The rainforest climate has a low value because the condition is almost stable all year round. Comparing with an icecap or hot desert climate which also has no seasonal variations, the rainforest climate has a higher value because its growing condition is obviously better.   

Climate features were extracted by propagating the climate normal dataset through the trained network and then retrieving the activations of the `concat` layer. The `concat` layer derives 512 climate features for clustering. It is not feasible to analyze them one by one, so principle component analysis (PCA) was applied first. Out of the 512 components after PCA, 15 components explained over 90% of the information. The most prominent three components on the 1991-2020 climate normals dataset are plotted and explained above. With the decreasing proportion of information explained, the climatological or biophysiological meanings of the features become more obscure and harder to interpret. Still from the three illustrated, we can see that the network did learn a lot of informative features that indicate the underlying land cover conditions.

The next section will talk about the clustering on the 15 principle climate features and derive our climate classification (clustering) scheme.
