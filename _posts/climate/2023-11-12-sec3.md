[Sec 2.](https://peace-van.github.io/climate/2023/11/11/sec2.html) discussed the results of NN vegetation mapping and we got the climate features. After PCA we choose 15 principal components that explain over 90% of the total variance, and the top 3 were interpreted in the last section. In this section we will talk about a preliminary clustering on the features.

## Why SOM?

Remember in the [Köppen](https://peace-van.github.io/climate/2023/11/05/koppen.html) scheme, especially within the main groups **C** and **D**, the structure is highly organized (as 2D tables in my article). Naturally and as seen from the output of the NN, temperature, aridity and seasonality are three main axes for the climate space. In view of this fact and for the sake of human interpretability of the proposed climate classification scheme, it's best to adopt a clustering method that **preserves and highlights the intrinsic topology of the climate space**, and that's what [self-organizing map (SOM)](https://www.mathworks.com/help/deeplearning/ug/cluster-with-self-organizing-map-neural-network.html) is good at. Basically it's a centroid-based clustering method just like $k$-means, but it enforces a pre-set topology of clusters by an ordering phase in training.   

> If a large number of neurons are pre-set, it actually does not enforce any topology. Data fall into the closest neuron to present their topology by the activation strength of different neurons after training finishes. In this way, like BIRCH, SOM functions as a preliminary dimension-reduction method and leaves the intermediate result for other clustering methods. We don't take this route at this time. We will investigate the topology of our climate features beforehand and enforce a topology that combines human knowledge of climates and analysis of the data, using SOM as a clustering method directly.    

> To address the shortcoming of the simple scheme derived by this simple method, later we will leverage the above methodology and derive a climate classification scheme with more details.   

## Choice of SOM topology

From the histogram it can be seen that the distribution of damp-coldness has two peaks with a transitional interval. The two peaks can be regarded as the vast warm (tropical plus subtropical) zone and the cold (arctic plus subarctic) zone. The temperate zone, sitting in the interval, actually does not cover a large portion of land. On the other hand, the distributions of the other two features are both right-leaning, indicating that the continental area is larger than the non-continental area, and that the area with seasonal climatic characteristics is larger than the non-seasonal. By this analysis we can see the climate types should roughly follow a **$3 \times 2 \times 2$** scheme.   

The standard deviation of the three features are 5.41, 3.66, 3.39 respectively, roughly following the 3:2:2 ratio. The standard deviation of the fourth feature significantly drops to 2.30, so a 3D SOM is good to work.   

## Result

Following the same suit of NN training, we use all the $21 \times 66501 = 1396521$ instances in clustering, covering 21 annual sets of climate normals. Each instance has 15 features (i.e., a $1 \times 15$ vector). The SOM derives 12 cluster centroids through training, with which we could assign clusters (climate types) for each set of climate normals. In this way the climate classification model remains constant through the years, and historical analysis could make sense. 

> Surely due to the accelerating climate change, when necessary (for example once every decade), the model could be re-trained with the newest climate and land cover data. This is one of the strengths of our data-oriented method - it's easy to update the model.    

> The trained NN, PCA and SOM models are three components of our climate classification scheme. When we would like to classify the climate for a place, feed the climate data into the trained NN, let the output of the `concat` layer go through the trained PCA (which is a linear transform), pick the first 15 principal components and find its nearest neighbor among the 12 SOM cluster centroids.

The $3 \times 2 \times 2$ SOM scheme on *climate features*, based on 1991-2020 climate normals. The climate features are the output of the `concat` layer of the NN.         

![p2](/assets/NN3/biome.png)
The output of the same methodology applied on *biome features*, based on 1991-2020 climate normals. The biome features are the output of the `relu-2` layer of the NN. Compared with climate features, one regression block is passed through. The clusters are not named.        

![p3](/assets/NN3/pred_veg.png)
The output of the NN (predicted land cover). Compared with biome features, one more regression block is passed through. Color scheme see [Sec 2](https://peace-van.github.io/climate/2023/11/11/sec2.html).  

Detailed interpretation and analysis of this scheme will come in the next section. Here I would like to discuss about the difference between **climate classification** and **biome classification** again. It can be seen that the biome classification is closer to the land cover, hiding the climatic conditions. For example, as mentioned in [Preface](https://peace-van.github.io/climate/2023/11/05/koppen.html), Northeast China is assigned the same cluster with the Yangtze River Plain, as well as the Europe, Western Siberia and Northeastern US. Also, the Australian desert receives a different biome classification with the Sahara desert, while in climate classification their behavior are similar. One prominant difference lies in Northern Canada and the vast Siberia, where in biome classification the boundaries are latitudinal and in climate classification they are longitudinal. How do the similar climate conditions result in different biomes? It can be an interesting topic for further discussion. From a standpoint of the data model, the question asks for investigation into how the NN's regression block works. The `fc-2` layer assigns different weights to different climate features, exaggerating the slight climatic differences in certain areas. This reflects different vegetation types' preferences/sensitivities for climate features. The biology community should already have an answer to this, and we are just seeking a fit to data models.   

> It can be seen in the [Köppen](https://peace-van.github.io/climate/2023/11/05/koppen.html) scheme the dividing lines in the boreal are latitudinal. Without the data model it's really hard to distinguish between climate classification and biome classification.    

> How do the different climate conditions result in "similar biomes"? This one is easy to answer. The so-called "similar biomes" are not truly similar, but a defect in our land cover scheme. The land cover types are not granular enough to reflect the differences between some areas. For example, even though Northeast China and the Yangtze River Plain are both predominated by crops and forests, the species are different. This difference in species is not sufficiently reflected in the land cover types. If we have a different land cover scheme, it will definitely lead to a different climate classification under our methodology. For instance, if the land cover scheme has a distinct Mediterranean vegetation type, the Mediterranean climate type would definitely be more pronounced in the result.    

> I'm not going to look into biome classification at this time. Maybe later, or for someone who is interested.
