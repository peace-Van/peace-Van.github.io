In [Sec 3](https://peace-van.github.io/climate/2023/11/12/sec3.html) we used a `322` SOM and did a simple clustering. The resulting scheme is clear and concise, but at a sacrifice of granularity - there's even not a subtropical climate type which is often not negligible. So we are going to derive a climate classification scheme with more details. This section will focus on the methodology. Next section will focus on interpretation of the climate types.   

## 533 SOM

Recall the climate features we analyzed in [Sec 3](https://peace-van.github.io/climate/2023/11/12/sec3.html). The standard deviation of the three features are 5.41, 3.66, 3.39 respectively. Aside from 3:2:2, it's also acceptable to approximate the ratio as 5:3:3. Intuitively, this dilineates the globe into tropical, subtropical, temperate, subarctic and arctic - five thermal zones. Continentality and seasonality are also divided into three levels each.

Using this `533` SOM, we will have 45 climate types as shown above. The [Köppen](https://peace-van.github.io/climate/2023/11/05/koppen.html) scheme defined 30 climate types, and even that seems a bit excessive. Also in many cases it may sound redundant to have three seasonality levels like non-seasonal, slightly seasonal and significantly seasonal. 

It turns out that we **don't need the same granularity on the continentality-seasonality plane for all temperature levels**. In the coldest arctic zone, it doesn't matter for plant growth whether the climate is seasonal or continental - the coldness dominates everything. The need for granularity increases with temperature level. But the SOM is a rigid hexagonal grid which cannot be customized in this way, so we see a fractionated interior Greenland in the result. 

We need a way to merge the fractionated climate subtypes into a reasonably compact climate classification system, meanwhile preserving the unique climate characteristics for each individual type. The task is a clustering on 45 observations with 15 features.

> Though we only analyzed the top 3, we are actually working on 15 climate features, as noted in [Sec 3](https://peace-van.github.io/climate/2023/11/12/sec3.html).

## Why crystal clustering?

### Ward hierarchical clustering

Seeing that the number of observations is small, typically we first use the Ward hierarchical clustering tree to have a visualization of the data structure.

To show how crystal clustering is different from other clustering methods and is especially useful here, we will focus on the red circled part. Four subtypes are involved: `322-23`, `332-28`, `331-13`, `232-27`. In this naming convention the first three numbers are the coordinates in the SOM grid and the number after the hyphen is a linear index. 

> As discussed in [Sec 3](https://peace-van.github.io/climate/2023/11/12/sec3.html), the first coordinate indicates the thermal zone (increases with coordinate), the second coordinate indicates continentality (decreases with coordinate) and the third coordinate indicates seasonality (decreases with coordinate). The directions of the coordinates can be different in multiple trainings of the SOM.

![dists](/assets/NN6/dist.png)
The pairwise distances between the cluster centroids in the feature space.   

The distance between `322-23` and `332-28` is the closest, so this pair is connected in the linkage tree first, and then `331-13` and `232-27` are paired. This is the logic of the linkage tree. Based on this tree, the paired subtypes may be merged or not according to the desired granularity, but a cross merge is not allowed, e.g. `332-28` merging with `331-13`. This kind of cluster organization does not agree with traditional climate classification schemes and common knowledge - usually the Europe is deemed as temperate zone while `322-23` is subtropical, and the `232-27` is much colder. If we simply merge `322-23` and `332-28` according to their proximity, we are going to lose the layered thermal zone structure.   

### Crystal clustering

Crystal clustering is run on the 45 cluster centroids given $T=5.2$. The minimum spanning tree and the order of bond breaking are visualized below.

The MST forms a nice structure that reflects the intrinsic topology of the climate space - broadly speaking, the 1 and 2 thermal zones (cold) sit in the left branch, the 4 and 5 thermal zones (warm) sit in the right branch, and the 3 thermal zone (temperate) sits in between. It appears like the histogram of the first principal climate feature shown in [Sec 3](https://peace-van.github.io/climate/2023/11/12/sec3.html). 

The subtypes in the big red circle are an exception. It's tricky that their growing condition is closer to those in the 4, 5 thermal zones, so they are branched on the right side. During the run of the `greedy-backtrack` algorithm, after the fifth bond break, the structure as shown in the below figure is left out.

The `333-43` subtype. **Dm** in [the 322 scheme](https://peace-van.github.io/climate/2023/11/14/sec4.html).    

Even though the distance between `332-28` and `322-23` is slightly closer to that between `332-28` and `331-13`, the algorithm chooses to break the former first. It's due to **the effect of entropy**. Breaking the former bond gives a 3-3 separation over the six types, while breaking the latter gives a 1-5 separation. The former action results in a higher increase in entropy. In terms of climatology, this action separates the humid temperate zone (the lower section of `332-28`, `331-13` and `333-43`) with the subtropical-tropical humid zone (the upper section of `533-45`, `433-44` and `333-43`). **It's a separation of higher level that should be done over that on the lower branch which gives details.** This action takes into consideration not only the distance between two observations, but also the surrounding connected components. This explains the role of entropy in crystal clustering.      

What about the `232-27`? It's on the left branch (which represents the cold zone), not engaging with those humid temperate types at all! Upon the MST is built, `232-27` is differentiated. Given the observations not on the same branch of the MST, there's no chance that they are assigned in one cluster. This ensures that the data organization found by the MST is preserved in the clustering result.   

The Ward linkage tree is different from MST in that whenever two observations are connected, they form a new cluster with a new cluster centroid. However when constructing the MST, the observation is always at its original location in the feature space. This difference leads to different data organizations. The $k$-means clustering, implemented in a non-hierarchical manner, has the same objective with Ward linkage tree that minimizes the total within-cluster sum of squares. These methods don't engage much with the topology of clusters in the feature space.   

To sum up, **crystal clustering follows SOM's idea of structurization of clusters and is very suitable as a postprocessing method when topology of clusters is a concern.**    

## Kinetics in crystal clustering

Still on the red circled structure. Given $T=5.2$, the system finally evolves into a state of 26 clusters, where the three subtypes `322-23`, `332-28` and `331-13` form a 1-2 separation - the latter two are connected. 

It's easy to see that a state with lower $G$ exists - the former two connected and `331-13` isolated, because the entropy is the same for the 2-1 state, but the bond energy between `322-23` and `332-28` is higher than that between `332-28` and `331-13` (a higher bond energy means a closer proximity in the feature space). But it's not possible for the system to reach that state under this condition, as is shown below. 

There are two proposed routes to reach that state: 

- `332-28` first connects with `322-23`, then breaks with `331-13`
- `332-28` first breaks with `331-13`, then connects with `322-23`

As an example, let's calculate the $\Delta G$ of `332-28`'s connection with `322-23`.

$$\Delta S = S_{end} - S_{start} = -\frac{3}{45} \log \frac{3}{45} - (-\frac{2}{45} \log \frac{2}{45}  - \frac{1}{45} \log \frac{1}{45} )=-0.0424$$

$$\Delta H = - 1/d = - 1/4.6246 = - 0.2162$$

> Bond connection always has a negative $\Delta H$ and a negative $\Delta S$.

$$\Delta G = \Delta H - T \Delta S = -0.2162 + 5.2 * 0.0424 = 0.0043$$

A positive $\Delta G$ means the action is not possible. Similarly we know that `332-28` is not possible to break with `331-13` under the given $T$.   

Kinetics hold the system on a state with higher energy. But that state is even preferred over the state with lower energy (aka thermodynamically more stable state), because it's more structured. As  the above analysis shows, the breaking between `332-28` and `322-23` is significant.   

> Given $T=5$, the first route will get executed in the algorithm run. Besides, the system will not go over the last two breaks (24th and 25th).
