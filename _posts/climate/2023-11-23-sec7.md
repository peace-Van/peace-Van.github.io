[The last section](https://peace-van.github.io/climate/2023/11/17/sec6.html) described the 533 SOM-crystal clustering methodology to obtain this scheme. In this section we will make a light walkthrough of the climate classification scheme. We will go direct because we have go through a similar illustration in [Sec 4](https://peace-van.github.io/climate/2023/11/14/sec4.html). Before that we have a little bit postprocessing to do.

## Merging subtypes

By crystal clustering we get clusters of the subtypes. We don't directly re-label the land pixels of the clustered subtypes; instead we find the new cluster centroids by a weighted average of the subtypes' centroids. Say there's a cluster of subtypes whose centroids are $\mathbf{c}_1, \mathbf{c}_2, ..., \mathbf{c}_m$ (each is a 15-dimensional vector), and their land proportions as weights are $w_1, w_2, ..., w_m$, then we have the new cluster centroid as

$$\mathbf{C} = \sum_{i=1}^m w_i \mathbf{c}_i / \sum_{i=1}^m w_i $$

In this way we get 26 new cluster centroids by crystal clustering at $T=5.2$. For each land pixel, assign the type with its nearest neighbor among the new cluster centroids.

### The tropical group

### The subtropical group

### The continental group

### The temperate group

### The subarctic group

### The arctic group

It can be seen many climate types of interesting distinct characteristics are derived, especially shown in the fine temperate zone **E**. But the scheme is more complicated and harder to grasp compared with the `322` scheme. Both schemes can have their use under different scenarios.   

> The reason we choose $T=5.2$ is that, on one hand, we feel no need for more climate types other than the above 26. On the other hand, if we set a lower $T=5.1$, **EH** will be merged with **DH**. We consider **EH** as a meaningful type so $T=5.1$ or below is not favored. The choice of $T$ is case-specific and depends on the target.  

## Comparison with $k$-means clustering

The *kmeans-26* scheme, 1991-2020 climate normals. 

Above shows the result of $k$-means clustering on the original climate features dataset. As done in [Sec 4](https://peace-van.github.io/climate/2023/11/14/sec4.html), we set $k=26$ and the algorithm ran 200 iterations. The result is obviously poor, with Greenland and the Sahara Desert fractionated. It's because the $k$-means method favors a clustering with even-sized clusters and the two regions, despite their largely homogeneous climate conditions, are large in size. Also, $k$-means does not retain any structural information among the clusters.
