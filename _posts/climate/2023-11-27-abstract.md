## Abstract

Based on $0.5° \times 0.5°$ 30-year climate normals and land cover data, a simple convolutional neural network is designed to learn how local climate translates into vegetation, which is the ecological meaning of climate. The outputs of an intermediate layer are extracted and processed by PCA to obtain the 15 climate features for the next step of clustering. We analyzed and interpreted the three main features, which are the core concepts through this work. Then, through a simple 322 SOM, the `322` scheme is obtained. Without many details, the `322` scheme is highly structured and easy to understand and interpret at a high level. Next, the detailed `533-5.2` scheme with 26 climate types is developed by 533 SOM and crystal clustering. Each type in this scheme has distinct climatic characteristics. The above describes the backbone of this study.

This is a series of blog posts, so the writing style is generally casual and I avoid complex math representations. I hope you enjoy your journey through the beauty of data science and climate science.
